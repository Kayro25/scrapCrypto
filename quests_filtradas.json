Bigger rewards.\n#### Kick off the Lunar New Year with Checkpoint Momentum, where progress doesn’t reset, it compounds (๑˃̵ᴗ˂̵)و ﾖｼ!\n\n\nBuild momentum throughout the campaign and unlock some of the biggest rewards we’ve offered, designed to keep you moving into the new year and help with your points checking and tracking journey!\n\nCheckpoint Exchange is galloping towards testnet, but you may wonder, what is Checkpoint?\n\nGlad you asked. **Checkpoint** is a project where you can easily check and track your points. Paste any EVM addy or name and it resolves to points. Simple.\n\nYou can do lots of other things with Checkpoint as well; build apps, integrate projects and much more. BUT the most exciting part is trading points soon, from offchain to onchain, pretty neat huh?! (〃￣︶￣)人(￣︶￣〃)\n\nLearn more about Checkpoint with our  [docs](https://docs.checkpoint.exchange) OR check our [web app](https://checkpoint.exchange/?ref=galxe). \n\n---\n\n#### About CHECKPOINT MOMENTUM\n\nThis series of quests is not sequential, jump in anytime and take your shot at earning some sweet rewards. Better yet, rewards are guaranteed and claims are gas free. Momentum quests will end on February 28th or earlier, with claims open after.\n\nWith varying levels of difficulty, tasks, and entry requirements, there’s something for everyone to build momentum along the way.\n\nHave fun, GLHF, and Happy Lunar New Year  |^o^/!",
